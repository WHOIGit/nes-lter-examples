# Examples of using online data produced by the NES-LTER information management system (IMS)

This repository contains [example data](data) from NES-LTER along with executable code for downloading and visualizing the data in [Python](notebooks), [R](R), and [MATLAB](MATLAB).

The NES-LTER IMS is under development and its current capabilities include parsing "raw" data and producing cleaned-up CSV data that can be read by any programming language. Raw data includes both instrument data such as CTD bottle summary files, as well as PI-provided spreadsheets. (Some of this "raw" data is the result of some earlier processing but is considered "raw" from the perspective of the IMS because they require further processing to be immediately usable).

"Data cleaning" is the first part of the proposed data pipeline that would support queries and discovery, access to data, and export to external repositories, all through [RESTful web APIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) that can pull the data directly into your favorite tools. The idea is to reduce the data handling burden on PIs and other data users and create a streamlined, automated process for accessing and using NES-LTER data.

Although the data examples here are all in CSV format, the data pipeline will generate other formats as appropriate, e.g., NetCDF.

In the code examples, data is read from this GitHub repository and visualized in various useful ways. In our eventual data pipeline we will provide web APIs and will not be serving data from GitHub, but the code examples here would only have to be slightly modified (changing the access URL) to work with the data pipeline.

### What is "data cleaning"?

For data to be easily machine readable, it has to
* Be in a widely-supported, non-proprietary format (e.g., CSV, NetCDF)
* Contain consistent types of values for a given variable (e.g., not putting words in a date column)
* Link to other data through common variables (e.g., cruise/cast/niskin)
* Use variable names that are legal in programming langauges (e.g., "chl" instead of "Chl (Î¼g/l)")
* Not contain unnecessary variation (e.g., "> 10" and ">10" meaning the same thing)
* Use consistent ways of indicating missing values

"Cleaning" data is the process of taking data that doesn't meet some of these criteria and reformatting or otherwise modifying it to meet the criteria. In addition to cleaning data after the fact, the things that have to be done to clean a particular dataset can serve as recommendations for formatting or structuring the dataset going forward.

Data cleaning does not involve
* Changing any data values
* Computing derived values
* Doing QA/QC beyond correcting formatting issues

The data team are not experts in your science and won't make assumptions about it that could invalidate your analyses.

Our code for cleaning data is mostly contained in the [`nes-lter-ims` repository](https://github.com/nes-lter-ims). This code base will grow as we work on new data types and as new data is provided to us by PIs, and as we build out the REST API.
